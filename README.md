# Vinex-Game-of-Life

My version of the famous cellular automaton [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life)

## **Controls:**  
  **1.** Press the ***Random*** button for a randomly generated playing field. Each cell has a 50% chance of being alive.  
  **2.** Press the ***Draw*** button to create your own starting condition. Click or hold you left mouse button to select cells.   
  **3.** While in draw mode, press ***Space*** to toggle the eraser, which you can use to unselect cells.  
  **4.** If you're satisfied with the starting conditions hit ***Enter*** to let the game begin.  
  **5.** While the game is running you can press ***D*** to return to the draw mode and edit the current state of the game.  
  **6.** Alternatively you can press ***R*** to return to the main menu and reset the play field.
