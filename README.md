 # Vinex-Game-of-Life

My version of the famous cellular automaton [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life).

## **Dependencies:**
  **1.** Numpy  
  **2.** Pygame

## **Controls:**  
  **1.** Press the ***Random*** button for a randomly generated playing field. Each cell has a 50% chance of being alive.  
  **2.** Press the ***Draw*** button to create your own starting condition. Click or hold your left mouse button to select cells.  
  **3.** Press the ***Speed*** button to change the speed, enter the desired speed in FPS, and confirm with enter.  
         Numpad not supported.  
  **4.** While in draw mode, press ***Space*** to toggle the eraser, which you can use to unselect cells.  
  **5.** If you're satisfied with the starting conditions hit ***Enter*** to let the game begin.  
  **6.** While the game is running you can press ***D*** to return to the draw mode and edit the current state of the game.  
  **7.** Alternatively, you can press ***R*** to return to the main menu and reset the playing field.  
  **8.** To change the speed while in the game is running, press ***S***, enter a desired speed, and hit enter to continue.

### **ZIP**
    The VGoLexe.zip file contains an exe file of the game, which was created using cx_Freeze, as well as the dependencies in the *lib*  
    folder. To play the game without a having to worry about installing python and the depencies unzip it to a desired location  
    and make sure all of the contained files are within the same folder. Then simply run the VGoL.exe file.
