# Vinex-Game-of-Life

My version of the famous cellular automaton [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life)

## **Controls:**  
  *1.* Press the *Random* button for a randomly generated playing field. Each cell has a 50% chance of being alive.  
  *2.* Press the *Draw* button to create your own starting condition. Use your left mouse button to select cells.  
     Holding and dragging is supported.  
  *3.* While in draw mode, press *Space* to toggle the eraser, which you can use to unselect cells.  
  *4.* If you're satisfied with the starting conditions hit enter to let the game begin.  
  *5.* While the game is running you can press *D* to return to the draw mode and edit the current state of the game.  
  *6.* Alternatively you can press *R* to return to the main menu and reset the play field.
